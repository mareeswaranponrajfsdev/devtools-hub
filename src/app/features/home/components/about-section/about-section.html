  <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
  <p class="about-text">

    Our <strong>free online JSON formatter and validator</strong>
    is the ultimate tool for developers who need a quick,
    reliable way to format, beautify, minify, and validate JSON data.

    Whether you're working with REST APIs, debugging backend responses,
    parsing configuration files, or cleaning up messy JSON outputs,
    DevTools Hub makes JSON handling effortless and secure.

  </p>

  <!-- Paragraph 2 -->
  <p class="about-text">

    Unlike other JSON formatting tools, DevTools Hub runs entirely
    in your browser—no data is ever sent to external servers.

    API keys, authentication tokens, database credentials,
    and proprietary configuration data.

    Your JSON never leaves your computer.
